Using data from the California Health Interview Survey (CHIS), which contains demographic and health data including information on health insurance status, and text data obtained from CA and US health insurance-related bill descriptions, we aimed to answer the question of whether changes in health insurance over time are associated with legislative changes. We compiled the CHIS data of adult respondents from 2011-2020 and the data can be obtained from the UCLA Center for Health Policy Research (https://healthpolicy.ucla.edu/chis/data/Pages/GetCHISData.aspx). We obtained CA and US bill description data from LegiScan (https://legiscan.com/datasets). After tokenizing the bill descriptions and clustering the bills, evaluation of the clusters revealed bills that were specific to Medi-Cal. We used PCA and regression to examine whether there was an association between the tokens belonging to a bill and the percent change in people covered through Medi-Cal and uninsured the following year.
